# Pure Lift Gyms

[View live project here.](https://p-g1977.github.io/Pure-Lift-Gyms/)

This is an experimental site for a fictional company called Pure Fit Gyms. Completed for my Milestone 1 project in L5 Web Application Development. The site is designed to be responsive on a range of devices and easy to navigate. I wanted to make the site simple and interesting to hopefully capture the users view and keep them engaged.
