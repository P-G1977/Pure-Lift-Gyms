# Pure Lift Gyms

[View live project here.](https://p-g1977.github.io/Pure-Lift-Gyms/)

This is an experimental site for a fictional company called Pure Fit Gyms, completed for my Milestone 1 project in L5 Web Application Development. The site is designed to be responsive on a range of devices and easy to navigate. I wanted to make the site simple and interesting to hopefully capture the users view and keep them engaged.

## Typography

### Radley Font

![alt text](assets/docs/fonts/Radley-font.png "Radley Font")

Radley font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used on the main heading and subheadings of the site, with a fallback of the Serif font in case the font isn't being imported correctly. Radley is the font I thought looked strong and relevant for a gym website.

### Inter Font

 Inter font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used in the body of the website, with a fallback of the Serif font. Inter font is clear and simple which I thought worked well for descriptions and captions that are easy to read.
