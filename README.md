# Pure Lift Gyms

[View live project here.](https://p-g1977.github.io/Pure-Lift-Gyms/)

This is an experimental site for a fictional company called Pure Fit Gyms, completed for my Milestone 1 project in L5 Web Application Development. The site is designed to be responsive on a range of devices and easy to navigate. I wanted to make the site simple and interesting to hopefully capture the users view and keep them engaged.

Users of the website are able to find information about the gym, reviews from people who have used the gym, and an easy way to find / contact the gym for more information. There is also a Gallery page to show more information about what is available at the gym.

## Design

* ### Color Scheme

| Main Colors   | Typorgraphy   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Black         | Black         |
| White         |               |
| #f9f9f9       |               |
| #b4b4b4       |               |



* ### Typography

#### Radley Font

![alt text](assets/docs/fonts/Radley-font.png "Radley Font")

Radley font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used on the main heading and subheadings of the site, with a fallback of the Serif font in case the font isn't being imported correctly. Radley is the font I thought looked strong and relevant for a gym website.

#### Inter Font

 ![alt text](assets/docs/fonts/Inter-font.png "Radley Font")

 Inter font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is used in the body of the website, with a fallback of the Serif font. Inter font is clear and simple which I thought worked well for descriptions and captions that are easy to read.

* ### Imagery

    * The background hero image is designed to catch the user's attention and to quickly describe the purpose of the business to the visitor. The image looks like it is breaking through the landing page and has an energetic aesthetic.

* ### Wireframes

    * Home Page Desktop Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/desktop-wire.png)

    * Home Page Tablet Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/tablet-wire.png)

    * Home Page Mobile Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/mobile-wire.png)

    * Gallery Page Desktop Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/desktop-gall-wire.png)

    * Gallery Page Tablet Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/tablet-gall-wire.png)

    * Gallery Page Mobile Wireframe - [Link Here](assets/docs/wireframe/mobile-gall-wire.png)

The Wireframes have the full Navigation Bar on the Desktop and Tablet and a collapsed NavBar on the Mobile Wireframe. The Social Media Icons are on all Wireframes and shrink nicely on all screen sizes. The NavBar is bold and easy to read so I thought it would not be necessary for it to be the collapsed version on Tablet devices.

## Features

* Responsive on all device sizes.

* Navigation Bar

    * Sitting at the top of all three pages. The navigation links are situated to the right of the page.

    * On larger screen the navigation links show text; Home, About, Reviews, Gallery and Contact. The navigation bar collapses on smaller screens just below 768px, and the links are situated in the burger icon that expands when you click it with the links showing accross the right of the screen.

* The Header

    * There is a Company Logo at the top left of the header section, that will take the user to the home page when it is clicked.

    * The Company Logo and Header section set the main color theme; white, black and a linear gradiant grey.

* Favicon

    * Originally I tried to make a logo for the company into a Favicon. After trying differnt ideas I decided a more effective Favicon would be a simple dumbbell nect to the page name.

* Reviews from previous clients.

    * The reviews section is situated below the about section on the home page and consists of two reviews from a male and a female.
